## What is Big O Notation? Contrast Big O with Omega and Theta. Show 1 Code Example Each Of Linear Time Complexity and Quadratic Time Complexity. Due Tuesday 11th Week 12 Day 1

Big O Notation is the metric that is used to describe the efficiency of algorithms. It measures time complexity and sapce complexity in a given algorithm. Omega is the best possible result we can expect from an algorithm, theta is the average result we can expect from an algorithm at runtime.

## O(1) - Constant Complexity

Algorithms with an O(1) has the constant time to compute regardless of the number of inputs.

Example:

```js
tinyArray = Array(10).fill(0)
largeArray = Array(100000000).fill(0)

findFifthElementOfArray(tinyArray)
findFifthElementOfArray(largeArray)

function findFifthElementOfArray(arr) {
	return arr[4]
}
```

Both inputs take the same amount of time.

## O(N) - Linear Complexity

Algorithms with an O(N) complexity requires more time depending on the size of the input.

Example:

```js
// Creates this array: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
tinyArray = Array.from(Array(10).keys())
// Creates a very large array starting with: [0, 1, 2, 3 ...]
largeArray = Array.from(Array(100000000).keys())

findRandomNumberInArray(tinyArray)
findRandomNumberInArray(largeArray)

function findRandomNumberInArray(arr) {
  const randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (randomNum === arr[i]) return arr[i]
  }
}
```

The larger array will take more time to process.

## O(log(N)) - Logarithmic Complexity

Each time the input grows in an algorithm with a logarithmic complexity, the processing time required will increase by half of what is previously increased by.

```js
const n = 16777216

log(n)

function log(n) {
  let j = 0
  
  for(let i = n; i >.999; i /= 2) {
    console.log(
			`The result of iterion ${j} is ${i}`
		)
    j++
  }
}
```

With each iteration, we are reducing the results by half.

## O(N^2) - Quadratic Complexity

Each time the input grows in an algorithm with a quadratic complexity, the processing time required will grow exponentially.

```js
const fakeTwoDimensionArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

logArray(fakeTwoDimensionArray)

function logArray(arr) {
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    console.log(arr[i])
    for(let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++){
      console.log("i: ", arr[i], "j: ", arr[j])
    }
  }
}
```
