## What do the HTTP Status Codes represent?

HTTP status codes represent if a specific HTTP request has been completed. The status codes are grouped in five classes: Informational Responses (100-199), Successful Responses (200-299), Redirection Messages (300-399), Client Error Responses (400-499), and Server Error Responses (500-599).


## What are the Primary HTTP Verbs and what do they mean?

The Primary HTTP verbs are Get, which means the resource has been fetched and transmitted in the message body, Put or Post which creates a resource on the server and replaces a resource with the request payload, and Delete which deletes the specified resource.
