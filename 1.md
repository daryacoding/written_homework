## How does the Internet Work
In short, the internet is the backbone of the web, a large network of computers which communicate all together. Servers are used to communicate with the internet. Web pages are files on that server's harddrive. Every computer has their own unique Internet Protocal address, more commonly known as IP address. Computers we use in our everyday life aren't servers, but are known as clients. Clients connect to the Server's webpage, using their domain name since it is easier for humans to use (ex: google.com is the domain name we use on top of the IP address 142.250.190.78).
