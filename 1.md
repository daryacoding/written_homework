## How does the Internet Work
In short, the internet is the backbone of the web, a large network of computers which communicate all together. Servers are used to communicate with the internet. Web pages are files on that server's harddrive. Every computer has their own unique Internet Protocal address, more commonly known as IP address. Computers we use in our everyday life aren't servers, but are known as clients. Clients connect to the Server's webpage, using their domain name since it is easier for humans to use (ex: google.com is the domain name we use on top of the IP address 142.250.190.78). 

## What do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript do ?
HTML is the markup language that gives structure to our web content. CSS adds styling to HTML content. JavaScript is a scripting language that gives funcitionality to our webpages. The three coding languages work together to give structure and purpose to our web pages. When you run a webpage, you are running the code in the html, javascript, and css files that are linked in the HTML file. 

## What is the difference between backend and frontend?
Frontend is what is shown to the clients (your computer). HTML, CSS and JavaScript show up in the front end, and it is the part of the software that the user interacts with. The backend is the server side of the website and it takes raw data and packages it into recognizable pieces. It is the part of the website that the user does not see or interact with. Some backend languages are PHP, C++, Java, Python, and Node.js. The frontend is what the user sees and interacts with and the backend is how it all works.
